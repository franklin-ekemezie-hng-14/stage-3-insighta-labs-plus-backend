Backend Wizards — Stage 1 Task: Data Persistence & API Design Assessment

Congratulations on passing Stage 0. Stage 1 is live.

This stage is different. You're not just calling APIs anymore. You're building a system that stores data, handles duplicates, and serves it back through your own API.

Explainer video: link

What it should do

Accept a name, call three external APIs, apply classification logic, store the result in a database, and expose endpoints to manage that data.

The three APIs (all free, no key required):

 Genderize API — https://api.genderize.io?name={name}
 Agify API — https://api.agify.io?name={name}
 Nationalize API — https://api.nationalize.io?name={name}

Classification rules:
 Age group from Agify: 0–12 → child, 13–19 → teenager, 20–59 → adult, 60+ → senior
 Nationality: pick the country with the highest probability from the Nationalize response

The endpoints you're building

1. Create Profile POST /api/profiles
Request body:
 { "name": "ella" }
Success Response (201 Created):
 {
   "status": "success",
   "data": {
     "id": "b3f9c1e2-7d4a-4c91-9c2a-1f0a8e5b6d12",
     "name": "ella",
     "gender": "female",
     "gender_probability": 0.99,
     "sample_size": 1234, //count from Genderize API
     "age": 46,
     "age_group": "adult",
     "country_id": "DRC",
     "country_probability": 0.85,
     "created_at": "2026-04-01T12:00:00Z"
   }
 }
If the same name comes in again, do not create a new record. Return the existing one:
 {
   "status": "success",
   "message": "Profile already exists",
   "data": { ...existing profile... }
 }
2. Get Single Profile GET /api/profiles/{id}
Success Response (200):
 {
   "status": "success",
   "data": {
     "id": "b3f9c1e2-7d4a-4c91-9c2a-1f0a8e5b6d12",
     "name": "emmanuel",
     "gender": "male",
     "gender_probability": 0.99,
     "sample_size": 1234,
     "age": 25,
     "age_group": "adult",
     "country_id": "NG",
     "country_probability": 0.85,
     "created_at": "2026-04-01T12:00:00Z"
   }
 }
3. Get All Profiles GET /api/profiles
Optional query parameters: gender, country_id, age_group Query parameter values are case-insensitive (e.g. gender=Male and gender=male are treated the same) Example: /api/profiles?gender=male&country_id=NG
Success Response (200):
 {
   "status": "success",
   "count": 2,
   "data": [
     {
       "id": "id-1",
       "name": "emmanuel",
       "gender": "male",
       "age": 25,
       "age_group": "adult",
       "country_id": "NG"
     },
     {
       "id": "id-2",
       "name": "sarah",
       "gender": "female",
       "age": 28,
       "age_group": "adult",
       "country_id": "US"
     }
   ]
 }
4. Delete Profile DELETE /api/profiles/{id}
Returns 204 No Content on success.
Error Responses
All errors follow this structure:
 { "status": "error", "message": "<error message>" }
 400 Bad Request: Missing or empty name
 422 Unprocessable Entity: Invalid type
 404 Not Found: Profile not found
 500/502: Upstream or server failure

Edge cases:

 Genderize returns gender: null or count: 0 → return 502, do not store
 Agify returns age: null → return 502, do not store
 Nationalize returns no country data → return 502, do not store

502 error format:
 { "status": "error", "message": "${externalApi} returned an invalid response" }

Error Handling (External APIs)
 { "status": "502", "message": "${externalApi} returned an invalid response" }
 externalApi = Genderize | Agify | Nationalize
